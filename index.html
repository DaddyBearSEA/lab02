    <h2>Biography of Michael Mandell, Software Developer</h2>
    <img src="img/michaelmandell.png">

  </div>
  <main>
    <p>I am the former owner of M3 Bodyworks Massage Clinic in West Seattle. We employed up to 22 employees (18 LMP’s and 3
      administration staff) from 2005 till the end of 2014. We averaged 500 – 600 appointments a month with 4 rooms,
      working
      with 2 shifts from 9 AM-Midnight.</p>

    <p> I am a licensed massage practitioner in Washington State since 2004 (16 years). I studied at the Brian Utting
      School of Massage
      participating in its intensive 1,000 hours COMTA accredited professional massage license program. I am currently
      working on certificates in Upledger Craniosacral and Barrel Visceral manimpulation.</p>

    <p>My prior employment includes extensive experience in Customer Service Management in multiple industries,
      receiving
      many service awards dealing with the public and private sectors. I left the high-tech industry after working with
      three failed “startups” during the Tech Boom in 2003. I worked with fortune 100 companies like Coke-a-Cola,
      MetLife,
      AIG, and Medtronic as a Senior Project Manager / Business Analyst before starting massage school. </p>

    <p> I have worked with Customer Relation Management Systems/Salesforce Automation as well as Enterprise Portals and
      Accounting Systems. Most projects were combining and connecting systems together into an Enterprise Portal for
      centric
      goals and communication.</p>

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Code Fellows Software Developer
    </li>

    <h5>June, 2020 - present</h5>
    <p>Working on certification: Code 401: Advanced Software Development for Mobile Applications</p>

    <p>Students will learn how to create mobile games and apps for the Android and iOS operating systems. They will take
      their app ideas from concept to completion and learn the tools, frameworks, and best practices used by mobile
      developers around the world. </p>

    <li>
      Licensed Massage Therapist Lic# MA00019519
    </li>
    <h5>May, 2004 - Presnet</h5>
    <p>Started out as a sole proprietor renting to other massage therapist when my studio was empty. Then a clinic
      became available with 4 rooms in 2005. With two injuries back to back, I decided to create a space where other
      massage therapists could grow, learn, and be successful</p>
    <p>M3 Bodyworks Massage Clinic was born in 2005 and then moved to the existing location in 2010. After traveling in
      Europe at the beginning of 2014, I realized that running a clinic and having employees was not why I got into
      massage. I needed to get back to treatment and working individually with clients. So I sold in January, 2015,
      worked for the current company until October, 2015. Started my sole practice in December, 2015.</p>

    <p>Worked with insurance comapnies since 2005. They have so many rules and regulations, credentialling, systems and
      licenseing requirements. It's hard to work with clients on insurance due to pre-authorizations and insurance
      dictating what you can do for a specific diagnosis code. I only see cash clients now but maintain my current
      insurance clients as soon as COVID-19 is over.</p>

    <li>
      Project Manager / Business Analyst
    </li>
    <h5>September, 1996 - June, 2003</h5>
    <p>Worked with start-ups in the high-tech boom starting with iCat Corporation, Salespath Corporation, Bodyshop
      Digital, and Datachannel. Datachannel got purchased by Netegrity and wanted us to be on the road 90% of the time.
      At the time, I had 3 dogs and couldn't travel that much so took a layoff package in June. My severance and bonus
      paid for massage school. Later that September, 2003, Netegrity shut down the Bellevue office and moved people to
      the east coast.</p>
