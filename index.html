<h1>Hello - Lab 2 is a GO!</h1>

<main class="biography">
  <h3>Biography of Michael Mandell, Software Developer</h3>
<p>I am the former owner of M3 Bodyworks Massage Clinic in West Seattle employed up to 22 employees (18 LMP’s and 3
  administration staff) from 2005 till the end of 2014. We averaged 500 – 600 appointments a month with 4 rooms, working
  with 2 shifts from 9 AM-Midnight.</p>

<p> I am a licensed massage practitioner in Washington State since 2004 (16 years). I studied at the Brian Utting School of Massage
  participating in its intensive 1,000 hours COMTA accredited professional massage license program. I am currently working on certificates in Upledger Craniosacral and Barrel Visceral manimpulation.</p>

<p>My prior employment includes extensive experience in Customer Service Management in multiple industries, receiving
  many service awards dealing with the public and private sectors. I left the high-tech industry after working with
  three failed “startups” during the Tech Boom in 2003. I worked with fortune 100 companies like Coke-a-Cola, MetLife,
  AIG, and Medtronic as a Senior Project Manager / Business Analyst before starting massage school. </p>

<p> I have worked with Customer Relation Management Systems/Salesforce Automation as well as Enterprise Portals and
  Accounting Systems. Most projects were combining and connecting systems together into an Enterprise Portal for centric
  goals and communication.</p>

<h4>Code Fellows Software Developer</h4>
<h5>June, 2020 - present</h5>
<p>Working on certification: Code 401: Advanced Software Development for Mobile Applications</p>

<p>Students will learn how to create mobile games and apps for the Android and iOS operating systems. They will take their app ideas from concept to completion and learn the tools, frameworks, and best practices used by mobile developers around the world. </p>

<h4>Licensed Massage Therapist Lic# MA00019519</h4>
<h5>May, 2004 - Presnet</h5>
<p>Started out as a sole proprietor renting to other massage therapist when my studio was empty. Then a clinic became available with 4 rooms in 2005. With two injuries back to back, I decided to create a space where other massage therapists could grow, learn, and be successful</p>
<p>M3 Bodyworks Massage Clinic was born in 2005 and then moved to the existing location in 2010. After traveling in Europe at the beginning of 2014, I realized that running a clinic and having employees was not why I got into massage. I needed to get back to treatment and working individually with clients. So I sold in January, 2015, worked for the current company until October, 2015. Started my sole practice in December, 2015.</p>

<p>Worked with insurance comapnies since 2005. They have so many rules and regulations, credentialling, systems and licenseing requirements. It's hard to work with clients on insurance due to pre-authorizations and insurance dictating what you can do for a specific diagnosis code. I only see cash clients now but maintain my current insurance clients as soon as COVID-19 is over.</p>

<h4>Project Manager / Business Analyst</h4>
<h5>September, 1996 - June, 2003</h5>
<p>Worked with start-ups in the high-tech boom starting with iCat Corporation, Salespath Corporation, Bodyshop Digital, and Datachannel.  Datachannel got purchased by Netegrity and wanted us to be on the road 90% of the time. At the time, I had 3 dogs and couldn't travel that much so took a layoff package in June. My severance and bonus paid for massage school. Later that September, 2003, Netegrity shut down the Bellevue office and moved people to the east coast.</p>

<!--Instructions
As a user, I would like to learn about the site owner so I can get to know them better..

Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

 and any goals that you may have.

Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.

Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.

As a user, I would like a personalized welcome message so that I feel like I am interacting with the site owner.

Ask the user their name through a prompt()

Display that name back to the user through a custom greeting welcoming them to your site.

Display the user’s name back to them in your final message to the user.

Developer Style Guide
A style guide is a series of standards and practices that must be followed in order for your code to be accepted by the team. This can include variable naming, file structure, and process. Below is a list of practices that you will be required to follow within this lab:

Your JS file must contain a 'use strict' declaration at the top, and your javascript file must be linked in your html file as an external script file.

Make sure that all code is cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.

Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.

Stretch Goals
After completing all of the requirements listed above, you may optionally challenge yourself further by implementing some or all of the following into your application.

Push yourself in your CSS work. Experiment, try some layout feature or technique that you have not tried before (maybe a sticky header or sticky footer, icon fonts such as FontAwesome, etc.) or just try to refine your layout/style as much as possible. We will not cover responsive design until Code 301, but if you have background in it, implement a breakpoint for a mobile view.
Resources
Review and utulize these resouces when working with your lab.
